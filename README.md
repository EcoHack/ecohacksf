EcoHack SF
=========

Welcome to the November 2014 edition of EcoHack SF! This repository will be used to organize projects, data and ideas. If you've got something to say, head over to the [Issues page](https://github.com/EcoHack/ecohacksf/issues) and get started.

Please use [#ecohack](https://twitter.com/search?f=realtime&q=ecohack&src=typd) on social media. And if you have any questions, hit us up at <a mailto:info@ecohack.org>info@ecohack.org</a>.

### Projects

Anyone can propose a project on Saturday. But to get the brain juices flowing, please use the [Issues page](https://github.com/EcoHack/ecohacksf/issues) to tell us about your awesome idea or fascinating dataset. Use tags as appropriate (e.g. `dataset` or `project/idea` or whatever).

### Timing on Saturday

9:00-9:45 - breakfast  
9:45-10:15 - get started, project presentations, etc.  
10:15 onward - hack!  
12:30ish - lunch  
6:30pm - dinner  
7:00pm - present your hack!

p.s. we're not meeting on Sunday, unlike the other EcoHack locations.

### Directions

Mapbox's office in San Francisco is at 149 9th Street. It's on 9th between Howard & Mission in a big brick building with an old-school sign that says “The Storex Building”. Once you reach the entrance use the intercom to call Suite 404 and we’ll buzz you in.
